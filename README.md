# hatEval
## Group 24
### Aim: 
The aim of this project is two-fold:
- We initially classify hateful tweets from a corpus where hate speech against
women or immigrants has been identified, as aggressive or not aggressive.
- Additionally, we classify these hateful tweets to identify if the target being
harassed is a generic group of people or a specific individual.

### How to run the code:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open jupyter notebook in the cloned directory
